title: Making pdb work with psyco 
---

**Note:** *This is a rewrite of an old blog post from way back, it
  still might be useful so I'm throwing it on here.*

[Pdb](http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html) (the python debugger)
does not play nice with [psyco](http://psyco.sourceforge.net/). Or maybe it's
the opposite. 
To illustrate this, 
let's start with a simple python program, that will surely provoke a
breakpoint:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/575083.js?file=hello_pdb.py"></script>

A debugging session with pdb should look like that:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/575099.js?file=pdb_psyco_session"></script>

So, what happenned here?
* We start a pdb debugging session on the hello_pdb.py file
* the pdb command `c` (continue) starts the program
* The program throws a `ZeroDivisionError`, pdb enters post-mortem
   debugging
* We try to inspect the environment : the variable `arg` does not exist,
   the `locals()` dictionnary is empty.

The reason for that is, when psyco is active, all your
psyco-compiled functions are stored away in a secret place which poor
pdb is not aware of.

At least 2 solutions exist. First, you could comment out the `psyco.full()`
statement for every debug session. However, this isn't always an
option, as some libraries always makes the use of [psyco][1] if it is
available. Uncommenting and recommenting in every third party library
is not a reasonable option.

So, how do I seamlessly disable psyco while debugging a module with
Pdb ? After some research, it seemed like the
[pydev](http://pydev.sourceforge.net) eclipse extension had just the
workaround I needed. First, we need a fake psyco module, implementing
the psyco interface. Something like this :

<script src="http://gist.github.com/575112.js?file=pdb_psyco_stub.py"></script></div>

This is just a copy of the pydevd_psyco_stub.py file shipped with
pydev, I'm not taking credit for anything here.

Next, we need to tell pdb to replace the psyco entry in `sys.modules`
with that fake module. This is done through the `.pdbrc` configuration
file. Conveniently, the `.pdbrc` file accepts plain python code, so it's
like super easy and stuff.  Here's my `.pdbrc` :

<script src="http://gist.github.com/575176.js?file=dotpdbrc"></script>


And that's it.

A few remarks :
* Both `.pdbrc` and `pydevd_psyco_stub.py` need to be in your home directory
* On Windows, this [means][2] putting them in an arbitrary folder, and
  then create a %HOME% environment variable pointing to that
  [directory][3]
* I strongly recommend the use of the `pprint` function (especially for
  inspecting your data while debugging)


So what does it mean for our test module from earlier ? Let me show it
to you :

<script src="http://gist.github.com/575180.js?file=pdb_psyco_stub_session"></script>

Great success.
