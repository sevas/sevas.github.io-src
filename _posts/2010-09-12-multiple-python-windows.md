title: Managing multiple python installations on Windows

## Problem

So sometimes, it might be good idea to keep several sandboxed python installations.
Here are some examples where such a scenario may occur:
* My default python installation is 2.7
* I want to keep my [EPD](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php) distribution clean
* The [Ogre3D bindings](http://www.pythonogre.com/) are only available for Python2.6 at the moment
* What about using python3 alongside everything else?


## A Solution

The idea here is to create a command prompt shortcut for every
concurrent python installation.

First, you need a `.bat` file that will set various environment
variables. Here is an example file, targetted at my EPD installation,
which is installed in `C:\Python26_EPD622`:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/575989.js?file=epd62.bat"></script>

Copy this, and change the `PYTHON_ROOT` variable to the root folder of the python
installation you're configuring. Put the file anywhere you want to.

Next, we will create a shortcut to a windows command prompt that will
automatically call that script, and setup your environmnent.

Locate the folder containing the original *Command Prompt* shortcut.
On Windows Vista/7, it should be in:
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories`.  

Copy it, and rename it, for example to `Python26 (EPD 6.2) Command Prompt`.
Rigth click on it, select *Properties*. This should appear:

Change the target to: `%comspec% /k ""c:\path\to\epd62.bat""` and
click *OK*. Notice the two pairs of double quotes.

You can now move this shortcut wherever you see fit. You can keep it
in the start menu, create a special start menu folder for all your
python prompts, move it to the quicklaunch bar, and so on.

Once this is done, you can now:

* Launch a (i)python shell
* Install packages with `easy_install` or `pip`
* Launch any binary third party tool shipped with your python distribution

Repeat for every python installation.

## Final note

This is not a mean to register several python distribution with your IDE.
Any decent python IDE, such as [Pydev](http://pydev.org/) for eclipse or
[PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) let you register several
python interpreters.
